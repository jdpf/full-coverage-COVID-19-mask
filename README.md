## Features

This COVID-19 mask is designed for those who want a mask that:
 * Fully covers the chin all the way to the ears.
 * Fits snugly to the face.
 * Is fully reversible (and invertible for those so inclined).
 * Uses two drawstrings to keep things tight.
 * Offers a full-coverage pocket for filter media.
 * Uses a sub-orbital wire channel for the best fit.
 * A shaped look.
 * A shaped wire to address the nose.
 
These features aim to offer a mask that fits well, stays in place over many hours of usage, and that keeps air from blowing into your eyes or out the sides, as many masks do not fit the nose bridge well. 
 
I strongly suggest prototyping your fit with a paper towel (these sew quite nicely, especially the blue shop-towels).

## Materials

* Fine woven quilting cotton and Batik. Knits are not good for filtering. 
* Cotton or poly thread. 
* Universal 80/12 needle. 
* Cords are standard para-cord or Kernmantle style nylon cordage available from your local hardware store. Remember to finish the nylon cordage with heat to prevent unraveling (e.g.: lighter flame, soldering iron).
* Solid copper house-wire, 14 or 12 gauge.

## Tools

1. Computer (mobile?) and access to a working printer.
2. Sewing machine. Note: This pattern only uses straight-stitch (foot No 1). Stitch length is slightly tighter than normal, around 2.2 vs 2.4 on my Bernina.
3. Quilting clips (optional), jumbo paper-clips and straight pins.
4. Scissors and/or rotary wheel, straight-edge and mat.
5. Crochet hooks for threading para-cord ties.
6. (Steam) Iron and ironing board.
7. Pencil or wash-out fabric crayon and straight-edge.
8. Seam ripper.

This pattern is a quarter of the entire mask that is repeated 4 times with two flips. In other words: flip the pattern to make the two-halves of the front (outside) of the mask. Then do the same for the back (inside). Dart folds are always pointing out on the wrong-side of the fabric.

## Preparation

1. Acquire materials (from your local quilting shop) and print out this pattern. 
1. Confirm that the print-out is actual size by comparing the built-in ruler to an actual ruler. The top is inches, the bottom is centimeters. 
1. All seam allowances are 1/4 inches or 0.635 centimeters.
1. All seams should be back-tacked at the start and end of the seam.

## One-side build instructions 

2. With two layers of fabric wrong-side out (right-sides facing each other), cut fabric to the pattern.
3. Push straight-pins through the fabric at the vertex of the darts (circled) to mark the ends of the darts. If one is very concerned about the pin-holes then a marker will work here too.
4. Remove the pattern and pins.
5. Separate the two halves, placing both right-side up. 
6. Place pins in the now existing holes, pushing into the fabric from the right-side. (Pins point away with pointy bits on the wrong-side of the fabric). Pin-holes are easy to see by holding the fabric up to a light-source. If you use quilting clips, then these 4 holes are the only pin-holes needed in the pattern. 
7. Fold the darts: first crease the fabric along the solid dart-fold lines. The pins are very helpful here in matching the wedges together and then tugging on the pin to find the right place for the fold.
 7. Fold the darts: fold dashed seam edges so darts are folded down towards the bottom of the mask. Keeping all folds oriented the same way will help when threading the cordage later.
 7. After darts are folded, clip darts together at back of mask. The mask should have curvature now, and edge A should form a straight line (or something close to it). 
 7. Repeat dart folds for the other piece.
 7. Iron darts to ensure stiff creases.
8. Sew darts A, B, C, back-tacking at the start and end of the sewing line. End each dart sew-line a finger-tip width away (as shown by the circles with 1/2 inch radius) from the peak of the dart to allow for a smoother curvature. 
8. Sew and back-tack the entire length of dart D: the nose-dart. The nose dart should be 5/8 inch long, as 1/4 to 3/8 inch of the nose dart will be used in the joining seam-allowance (edge D) and edge D joining fold.
9. Repeat dart sewing for the other piece.
10. Match the masks together with wrong-sides out. Join left and right sides of the mask together by pinning or clipping (preferred) and sewing the front seam, edge C, using a 1/4 inch seam allowance (e.g.: the edge of the sewing foot). Backtrack the start and end of this seam.
11. Repeat these build-instruction steps to complete inside (or outside) of the mask.

## Joining inside and outside together

1. With the completed inside and outside pieces, match them together with wrong-sides out. Confirm that wrong sides are out before sewing.
1. Match edges and clip or pin neckline edge B.
1. Sew edge B across the front (outside) and back (inside) of mask with a 1/4 inch seam allowance.
1. Match and clip or pin sub-orbital edges D together. It is wise to align the seams, with the seam allowances for the peak of the nose-piece on opposite sides from one another.
1. Sew front (outside) and back (inside) together, taking care to keep the seam line to the 1/4 inch seam allowance. Pivot by putting the needle down at the apex of the nose seam. 

## Test fit and cheek sizing

1. Invert the mask through the holes along edge A, so that the mask is right-side out on the inside and outside.
1. Holding the mask near edge A, pull it snugly up under the chin.
1. Use your fingers, feel for the start of the ear, and fold edge A down so that edge A just reaches the ear.
1. Once the fold location has been established, fold right-side of edge A into the hole to the desired length.
1. Test fit again until the now folded-in edge A is just short of the ear. When pulled tight with the cordage, it will meet the ear.
1. Iron folded-in edge A to establish a crease.

## Sewing cordage channel along edge A

1. Now that the cheek fit is nice, and edge A is folded into the hole, and ironed down, it is time to sew edge A.
1. Starting at the darts, sew the turned-in edge A with a 1/4 inch seam allowance. Back-tack at least 1/2 inch when crossing the seams (perpendicularly) for edges B and D. 
1. Sew a back-tack bar on the outermost folded part of edge A, perpendicular to the edge B and D seams. There are four of these. This back-tack bar will prevent the loop from unraveling from the movement of cordage.
1. Using a pick-a-stitch seam ripper, carefully unstitch the seam between the two back-tack bars along edges B and D, this will form the opening for the cordage. 

## Cutting and threading cordage

1. The main cord is 48 inches long. The neck-cord is 24 inches long. Cut cordage to length and finish with heat.
1. Push a Crochet hook from edge D to edge B along the outer face of the mask. If you invert the mask later, you will want to re-thread the cordage along the (now) outer face, so that the outermost face always houses the cordage run.
1. Thread cordage from edge D to B. The folds of the darts A, B, C should not interfere from this direction.
1. Thread cordage along edge B (through the mask).

## Top-sewing the wire channel

1. Top-stitch the wire channel by sewing about 3/8 inch down from the top edge D. 
1. Stop sewing about 5/8 inch from nose dart D.
1. Back-tack both ends of the top-stitch.

## Forming the wire

1. Cut a length of insulated solid copper house-wiring about 8 inches long.
1. Form the wire into a nose bridge and trace the sub-orbital cheekbone with the wire.
1. After the wire is formed, and the ends bent tightly over (to avoid tearing the mask), thread the mask onto the wire. 
1. In this design, the wire channel is open on both ends, so you can thread it from either side. Scrunch the mask up to go over bendy parts of the wire without changing the bend.

## Congratulations! Mask done! 

1. Put on your mask and practice physical distancing.
